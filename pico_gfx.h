    Summary:
    --------

    pico_gfx is a 2D, high-level wrapper for [sokol_gfx](https://github.com/floooh/sokol/blob/master/sokol_gfx.h),
    a low-level wrapper for OpenGL, Metal, D3D, and WebGPU written in C.
    pico_gfx is designed make the common case intuitive and convenient. It
    provides access to low-level constructs, such as render passes and pipelines,
    in a way that is easy to use and understand.

    pico_gfx includes a default shader (and pipeline), but can be extended using
    the sokol shader compiler (`sokol-shdc`) which allows for a shader to be
    written in a single language (e.g. GLSL) which is then transformed into
    shader sources for all suppported backends.

    One thing pico_gfx does not support (and neither does sokol_gfx) is window
    and graphics context creation. See [here](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/tree/master/src/internal)
    for some examples. It is worth mentioning that [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org)
    can supply both a window and OpenGL context out of the box. SDL2 is used
    in the demos.

    Another library that supports window/context creation on all supported
    backends is [sokol_app](https://github.com/floooh/sokol/blob/master/sokol_app.h),
    but it has yet to be tested with pico_gfx.

    State (pipeline/shader, the default uniform block, the viewport, scissor,
    and clear color, texture and sampler bindings) can be managed via the state
    stack. The stack enables changes to be isolated. Simply push the current
    state to the top of the stack, make some local changes, and then pop the
    stack to restore the original state.

    Shaders expose uniforms in blocks. These blocks must be registered with the
    shader by calling `pg_init_uniform_block`. They may then be set at will
    by calling `pg_set_uniform_block`. These functions typically operate on
    structs supplied by a custom shader,

    The default shader provides a uniform block containing a projection and
    transformation matrix that are used to map vertices to normalized device
    coordinates. This projection matrix can be set using `pg_set_projection`
    and the (model-view) transformation matrix can be set using
    `pg_set_transform`. They can be reset to the identity by calling
    `pg_reset_projection` and `pg_reset_transform` respectively. Note,
    these functions only work with the default shader.

    Please see the examples for more details.

    C++
    --------

    In this iteration, pico_gfx is a C only library. Proper C++ compatibility
    may be introduced in the future.

    Build:
    --------

    To use this library in your project, add

    > #define PICO_GFX_IMPLEMENTATION
    > #include "pico_gfx.h"

    to a source file.

    IMPORTANT: sokol_gfx.h must be in the include path!

    You must also define one of

    #define PICO_GFX_GL
    #define PICO_GFX_GLES
    #define PICO_GFX_D3D
    #define PICO_GFX_METAL
    #define PICO_GFX_WEBGPU

    before including pico_gfx.h

    See the examples for build details.

    Constants:
    --------

    - PICO_GFX_STACK_MAX_SIZE (default: 16)
    - PICO_GFX_BUFFER_SIZE (default: 16384)
    - PICO_GFX_HT_MIN_CAPACITY (default: 8)
    - PICO_GFX_HT_KEY_SIZE (default: 16)
    - PICO_GFX_MIN_ARENA_CAPACITY (default: 1024)
    - PICO_GFX_MAX_TEXTURE_SLOTS (default: 16)
    - PICO_GFX_MAX_SAMPLER_SLOTS (default: 16)

    Customization:
    --------

    - NDEBUG
    - PICO_GFX_ASSERT
    - PICO_GFX_LOG
    - PICO_GFX_MALLOC
    - PICO_GFX_REALLOC
    - PICO_GFX_FREE

    The above (constants/macros) must be defined before PICO_GFX_IMPLEMENTATION
